	<h2>What I like!</h2>
		<p>What I like to do. First, I love to go fishing! Fishing is the best when it's a nice day out because of the action it gives you when you set the hook. 
		   I love fishing for largemouth bass cause they put up a good fight. Fishing gives me peace of mind. Second, I have a passion for car because me myself I am a car enthusiast. 
		   I owned a very nice sport car, which is a 2019 Subaru Wrx Sti. I love to stare at it because I look at it as one of my hard work to own one of these cars. 
		   I also love to work on it whenever I am not doing anything outdoor. 
		   Lastly, I love computers! I have built many computers in the past, and the one in the picture is my current recent build that I have made. 
		   I love technologies cause they are evolving every day.
		</p>
